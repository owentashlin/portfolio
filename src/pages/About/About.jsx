            <h1>lets talk about me</h1>
            <p>Coming out of a design and invention background, I approach front end and full stack software development as an opportunity to find new solutions. I excel in environments that allow for collaboration and free exchange of ideas, as many eyes on a problem will always yield a better resolution in the end. I have extensive customer service experience in both media and medical environments, which has given me a good understanding of how a user experience effects the impression of a brand as a whole. This combination of problem solving mentality and understanding of customer experience has given me a valuable perspective when training and supervising others, as well as in my own work.</p>
